# It is used to mount/umount FS based on this label 
# One can list this partition and based on label mount/umount ...
# It is usefull as I have several distro and need to check them from another one.
# See usage -h

3 - run_acpi 
# This script has been build to  start/stop discrete card on hybrid graphix
# A module need to be compiled every kernel release from an original code called acpi_call.c
